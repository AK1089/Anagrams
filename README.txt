Anagrams rules (single player):


The start menu allows you to choose the settings: how many letters you would like (3-10) and the length of your game (10-300 seconds). Press start to begin.

Some letters will then appear on the screen. Your objective is to make as many words as possible before time runs out.

These words must be at least 3 letters long, and each letter can only be used once. There is always at least one word using all of the letters.

Click on a letter in the bottom row to use it, and click on a letter in the top row to remove it.

Press submit to check your word. You get more points for longer words.

Once time runs out, you will see your score and the words you got. You will also see what the long word was (the one using all the letters).




Anagrams rules (two player):


This works in a similar way to single player, except the first player picks the settings.

Once the first player has finished their round (running Player1.py), the second player can play using Player2.py.

When player 2 is finished, they will see information regarding the winner.






Good luck!
